#'
#' Used internally, to summarise posterior distributions, but the logic does

#'   faster, but may be less appropriate for skewed distribution).
#' @param interval_width single numeric value (`> 0` and `<1`); the width of the
#'   interval; default is 0.95, corresponding to 95% percentile-base credible
#'   intervals for posterior distributions.

#' Generate draws from posterior normal distributions
#'
#' Used internally. This function generates draws from posterior, normal
#' distributions for continuous outcomes. Technically, these posteriors use no
#' priors (for simulation speed), corresponding to the use of improper flat
#' priors. These posteriors correspond (and give similar results) to using
#' normal-normal models (normally distributed outcome, conjugate normal prior)
#' for each arm, assuming that a non-informative, flat prior is used. Thus, the
#' posteriors directly correspond to normal distributions with each groups' mean
#' as the mean and each groups' standard error as the standard deviation.
#' As it is necessary to always return valid draws, in cases where `< 2`
#' patients have been randomised to an `arm`, posterior draws will come from an
#' extremely wide normal distribution with mean corresponding to the mean of all
#' included patients with outcome data and a standard deviation corresponding to
#' the difference between the highest and lowest recorded outcomes for all
#' patients with available outcome data multiplied by `1000`.

#' Setup a generic trial specification
#'
#' Specifies the design of an adaptive trial with any type of outcome and
#' validates all inputs. Use [calibrate_trial()] to calibrate the trial
#' specification to obtain a specific value for a certain performance metric
#' (e.g., the Bayesian type 1 error rate). Use [run_trial()] or [run_trials()]
#' to conduct single/multiple simulations of the specified trial, respectively.
#' \cr See [setup_trial_binom()] and [setup_trial_norm()] for simplified setup
#' of trial designs for common outcome types. For additional trial specification
#' examples, see the the **Basic examples** vignette
#' (`vignette("Basic-examples", package = "adaptr")`) and the
#' **Advanced example** vignette
#' (`vignette("Advanced-example", package = "adaptr")`).
#'
#'
#' @param arms character vector with unique names for the trial arms.
#' @param true_ys numeric vector specifying true outcomes (e.g., event
#'   probabilities, mean values, etc.) for all trial `arms`.
#' @param fun_y_gen function, generates outcomes. See [setup_trial()]
#'   **Details** for information on how to specify this function.\cr
#'   **Note:** this function is called once during setup to validate its output
#'   (with the global random seed restored afterwards).
#' @param fun_draws function, generates posterior draws. See [setup_trial()]
#'   **Details** for information on how to specify this function.\cr
#'   **Note:** this function is called up to three times during setup to
#'   validate its output (with the global random seed restored afterwards).
#' @param start_probs numeric vector, allocation probabilities for each arm at
#'   the beginning of the trial. The default (`NULL`) automatically generates
#'   equal randomisation probabilities for each arm.
#' @param fixed_probs numeric vector, fixed allocation probabilities for each
#'   arm. Must be either a numeric vector with `NA` for arms without fixed
#'   probabilities and values between `0` and `1` for the other arms or `NULL`
#'   (default), if adaptive randomisation is used for all arms or if one of the
#'   special settings (`"sqrt-based"`, `"sqrt-based start"`,
#'   `"sqrt-based fixed"`, or `"match"`) is specified for `control_prob_fixed`
#'   (described below).
#' @param min_probs numeric vector, lower threshold for adaptive allocation
#'   probabilities; lower probabilities will be rounded up to these values. Must
#'   be `NA` (default for all arms) if no lower threshold is wanted and for arms
#'   using fixed allocation probabilities.
#' @param max_probs numeric vector, upper threshold for adaptive allocation
#'   probabilities; higher probabilities will be rounded down to these values.
#'   Must be `NA` (default for all arms) if no threshold is wanted and for arms
#'   using fixed allocation probabilities.
#' @param data_looks vector of increasing integers, specifies when to conduct
#'   adaptive analyses (= the total number of patients with available outcome
#'   data at each adaptive analysis). The last number in the vector represents
#'   the final adaptive analysis, i.e., the final analysis where superiority,
#'   inferiority, practical equivalence, or futility can be claimed.
#'   Instead of specifying `data_looks`, the `max_n` and `look_after_every`
#'   arguments can be used in combination (in which case `data_looks` must be
#'   `NULL`, the default value).
#' @param max_n single integer, number of patients with available outcome data
#'   at the last possible adaptive analysis (defaults to `NULL`).
#'   Must only be specified if `data_looks` is `NULL`. Requires specification of
#'   the `look_after_every` argument.
#' @param look_after_every single integer, specified together with `max_n`.
#'   Adaptive analyses will be conducted after every `look_after_every`
#'   patients have available outcome data, and at the total sample size as
#'   specified by `max_n` (`max_n` does not need to be a multiple of
#'   `look_after_every`). If specified, `data_looks` must be `NULL` (default).
#' @param randomised_at_looks vector of increasing integers or `NULL`,
#'   specifying the number of patients randomised at the time of each adaptive
#'   analysis, with new patients randomised using the current allocation
#'   probabilities at said analysis.
#'   If `NULL` (the default), the number of patients randomised at each analysis
#'   will match the number of patients with available outcome data at said
#'   analysis, as specified by `data_looks` or `max_n` and `look_after_every`,
#'   i.e., outcome data will be available immediately after randomisation for
#'   all patients.\cr
#'   If not `NULL`, the vector must be of the same length as the number of
#'   adaptive analyses specified by `data_looks` or `max_n` and
#'   `look_after_every`, and all values must be larger than or equal to the
#'   number of patients with available outcome data at each analysis.
#' @param control single character string, name of one of the `arms` or `NULL`
#'   (default). If specified, this arm will serve as a common control arm, to
#'   which all other arms will be compared and the
#'   inferiority/superiority/equivalence thresholds (see below) will be for
#'   those comparisons. See [setup_trial()] **Details** for information on
#'   behaviour with respect to these comparisons.
#' @param control_prob_fixed if a common `control` arm is specified, this can
#'   be set `NULL` (the default), in which case the control arm allocation
#'   probability will not be fixed if control arms change (the allocation
#'   probability for the first control arm may still be fixed using
#'   `fixed_probs`). If not `NULL`, a vector of probabilities of either length
#'   `1` or `number of arms - 1` can be provided, or one of the special
#'   arguments `"sqrt-based"`, `"sqrt-based start"`, `"sqrt-based fixed"` or
#'   `"match"`. See [setup_trial()] **Details** for details on how this affects
#'   trial behaviour.
#' @param inferiority single numeric value or vector of numeric values of the
#'   same length as the maximum number of possible adaptive analyses, specifying
#'   the probability threshold(s) for inferiority (default is `0.01`). All
#'   values must be `>= 0` and `<= 1`, and if multiple values are supplied, no
#'   values may be lower than the preceding value. If a common `control`is not
#'   used, all values must be `< 1 / number of arms`. An arm will be considered
#'   inferior and dropped if the probability that it is best (when comparing all
#'   arms) or better than the control arm (when a common `control` is used)
#'   drops below the inferiority threshold at an adaptive analysis.
#' @param superiority single numeric value or vector of numeric values of the
#'   same length as the maximum number of possible adaptive analyses, specifying
#'   the probability threshold(s) for superiority (default is `0.99`). All
#'   values must be `>= 0` and `<= 1`, and if multiple values are supplied, no
#'   values may be higher than the preceding value. If the probability that an
#'   arm is best (when comparing all arms) or better than the control arm (when
#'   a common `control` is used) exceeds the superiority threshold at an
#'   adaptive analysis, said arm will be declared the winner and the trial will
#'   be stopped (if no common `control` is used or if the last comparator is
#'   dropped in a design with a common control) *or* become the new control and
#'   the trial will continue (if a common control is specified).
#' @param equivalence_prob single numeric value, vector of numeric values of the
#'   same length as the maximum number of possible adaptive analyses or `NULL`
#'   (default, corresponding to no equivalence assessment), specifying the
#'   probability threshold(s) for equivalence. If not `NULL`, all values must be
#'   `> 0` and `<= 1`, and if multiple values are supplied, no value may be
#'   higher than the preceding value. If not `NULL`, arms will be dropped for
#'   equivalence if the probability of either *(a)* equivalence compared to a
#'   common `control` or *(b)* equivalence between all arms remaining (designs
#'   without a common `control`) exceeds the equivalence threshold at an
#'   adaptive analysis. Requires specification of `equivalence_diff` and
#'   `equivalence_only_first`.
#' @param equivalence_diff single numeric value (`> 0`) or `NULL` (default,
#'   corresponding to no equivalence assessment). If a numeric value is
#'   specified, estimated absolute differences smaller than this threshold will
#'   be considered equivalent. For designs with a common `control` arm, the
#'   differences between each non-control arm and the `control` arm is used, and
#'   for trials without a common `control` arm, the difference between the
#'   highest and lowest estimated outcome rates are used and the trial is only
#'   stopped for equivalence if all remaining arms are equivalent.
#' @param equivalence_only_first single logical in trial specifications where
#'   `equivalence_prob` and `equivalence_diff` are specified and a common
#'   `control` arm is included, otherwise `NULL` (default). If a common
#'   `control` arm is used, this specifies whether equivalence will only be
#'   assessed for the first control (if `TRUE`) or also for subsequent `control`
#'   arms (if `FALSE`) if one arm is superior to the first control and becomes
#'   the new control.
#' @param futility_prob single numeric value, vector of numeric values of the
#'   same length as the maximum number of possible adaptive analyses or `NULL`
#'   (default, corresponding to no futility assessment), specifying the
#'   probability threshold(s) for futility. All values must be `> 0` and `<= 1`,
#'   and if multiple values are supplied, no value may be higher than the
#'   preceding value. If not `NULL`, arms will be dropped for futility if
#'   the probability for futility compared to the common `control` exceeds the
#'   futility threshold at an adaptive analysis. Requires a common `control`
#'   arm (otherwise this argument must be `NULL`), specification of
#'   `futility_diff`, and `futility_only_first`.
#' @param futility_diff single numeric value (`> 0`) or `NULL` (default,
#'   corresponding to no futility assessment). If a numeric value is specified,
#'   estimated differences below this threshold in the *beneficial* direction
#'   (as specified in `highest_is_best`) will be considered futile when
#'   assessing futility in designs with a common `control` arm. If only 1 arm
#'   remains after dropping arms for futility, the trial will be stopped without
#'   declaring the last arm superior.
#' @param futility_only_first single logical in trial specifications designs
#'   where `futility_prob` and `futility_diff` are specified, otherwise `NULL`
#'   (default and required in designs without a common `control` arm).
#'   Specifies whether futility will only be assessed against the first
#'   `control` (if `TRUE`) or also for subsequent control arms (if `FALSE`) if
#'   one arm is superior to the first control and becomes the new control.
#' @param highest_is_best single logical, specifies whether larger estimates of
#'   the outcome are favourable or not; defaults to `FALSE`, corresponding to,
#'   e.g., an undesirable binary outcomes (e.g., mortality) or a continuous
#'   outcome where lower numbers are preferred (e.g., hospital length of stay).
#' @param soften_power either a single numeric value or a numeric vector of
#'   exactly the same length as the maximum number of looks/adaptive analyses.
#'   Values must be between `0` and `1` (default); if `< 1`, then re-allocated
#'   non-fixed allocation probabilities are all raised to this power (followed
#'   by rescaling to sum to `1`) to make adaptive allocation probabilities
#'   less extreme, in turn used to redistribute remaining probability while
#'   respecting limits when defined by `min_probs` and/or `max_probs`. If `1`,
#'   then no *softening* is applied.
#' @param fun_raw_est function that takes a numeric vector and returns a
#'   single numeric value, used to calculate a raw summary estimate of the
#'   outcomes in each `arm`. Defaults to [mean()], which is always used in the
#'   [setup_trial_binom()] and [setup_trial_norm()] functions.\cr
#'   **Note:** the function is called one time per arm during setup to validate
#'   the output structure.
#' @param cri_width single numeric `>= 0` and `< 1`, the width of the
#'   percentile-based credible intervals used when summarising individual trial
#'   results. Defaults to `0.95`, corresponding to 95% credible intervals.
#' @param n_draws single integer, the number of draws from the posterior
#'   distributions for each arm used when running the trial. Defaults to
#'   `5000`; can be reduced for a speed gain (at the potential loss of stability
#'   of results if too low) or increased for increased precision (increasing
#'   simulation time). Values `< 100` are not allowed and values `< 1000` are
#'   not recommended and warned against.
#' @param robust single logical, if `TRUE` (default) the medians and median
#'   absolute deviations (scaled to be comparable to the standard deviation for
#'   normal distributions; MAD_SDs, see [stats::mad()]) are used to summarise
#'   the posterior distributions; if `FALSE`, the means and standard deviations
#'   (SDs) are used instead (slightly faster, but may be less appropriate for
#'   posteriors skewed on the natural scale).
#' @param description optional single character string describing the trial
#'   design, will only be used in print functions if not `NULL` (the default).
#' @param add_info optional single string containing additional information
#'   regarding the trial design or specifications, will only be used in print
#'   functions if not `NULL` (the default).

#'
#' \strong{How to specify the `fun_y_gen` function}
#'
#' The function must take the following arguments:
#' - `allocs`: character vector, the trial `arms` that new patients allocated
#' since the last adaptive analysis are randomised to.
#'
#' The function must return a single numeric vector, corresponding to the
#' outcomes for all patients allocated since the last adaptive analysis, in the
#' same order as `allocs`.\cr
#' See the **Advanced example** vignette
#' (`vignette("Advanced-example", package = "adaptr")`) for an example with
#' further details.
#'
#' \strong{How to specify the `fun_draws` function}
#'
#' The function must take the following arguments:
#' - `arms`: character vector, the unique trial `arms`, in the same order as
#' above, but only the **currently active** arms are included when the function
#' is called.
#' - `allocs`: a vector of allocations for all patients, corresponding to the
#' trial `arms`, including patients allocated to both
#' **currently active AND inactive** `arms` when called.
#' - `ys`: a vector of outcomes for all patients in the same order as `allocs`,
#' including outcomes for patients allocated to both
#' **currently active AND inactive** `arms` when called.
#' - `control`: single character, the current `control` arm, will be `NULL` for
#' designs without a common control arm, but required regardless as the argument
#' is supplied by [run_trial()]/[run_trials()].
#' - `n_draws`: single integer, the number of posterior draws for each arm.
#'
#' The function must return a `matrix` (containing numeric values) with `arms`
#' named columns and `n_draws` rows. The `matrix` must have columns
#' **only for currently active arms** (when called). Each row should contain a
#' single posterior draw for each arm on the original outcome
#' scale: if they are estimated as, e.g., the *log(odds)*, these estimates must
#' be transformed to probabilities and similarly for other measures.\cr
#' Important: the `matrix` cannot contain `NA`s, even if no patients have been
#' randomised to an arm yet. See the provided example for one way to alleviate
#' this.\cr
#' See the **Advanced examples** vignette
#' (`vignette("Advanced-example", package = "adaptr")`) for an example with
#' further details.
#'
#' _Notes_
#' - Different estimation methods and prior distributions may be used;
#' complex functions will lead to slower simulations compared to simpler
#' methods for obtaining posterior draws, including those specified using the
#' [setup_trial_binom()] and [setup_trial_norm()] functions.
#' - Technically, using log relative effect measures — e.g. log(odds ratios) or
#' log(risk ratios) - or differences compared to a reference arm (e.g., mean
#' differences or absolute risk differences) instead of absolute values in each
#' arm will work to some extent (**be cautious!**):
#' - Stopping for superiority/inferiority/max sample sizes will work.
#' - Stopping for equivalence/futility may be used with relative effect
#' measures on the log scale, but thresholds have to be adjusted accordingly.
#' - Several summary statistics from [run_trial()] (`sum_ys` and posterior
#' estimates) may be nonsensical if relative effect measures are used
#' (depending on calculation method; see the `raw_ests` argument in the
#' relevant functions).
#' - In the same vein, [extract_results()] (`sum_ys`, `sq_err`, and
#' `sq_err_te`), and [summary()] (`sum_ys_mean/sd/median/q25/q75/q0/q100`,
#' `rmse`, and `rmse_te`) may be equally nonsensical when calculated on
#' the relative scale (see the `raw_ests` argument in the relevant functions.
#'
#' \strong{Using additional custom or functions from loaded packages in the
#' custom functions}
#'
#' If the `fun_y_gen`, `fun_draws`, or `fun_raw_est` functions calls other
#' user-specified functions (or uses objects defined by the user outside these
#' functions or the [setup_trial()]-call) or functions from external packages
#' and simulations are conducted on multiple cores, these objects or functions
#' must be exported or prefixed with their namespaces, respectively, as
#' described in [setup_cluster()] and [run_trials()].
#'
#' \strong{More information on arguments}
#' - `control`: if one or more treatment arms are superior to the control arm
#' (i.e., passes the superiority threshold as defined above), this arm will
#' become the new control (if multiple arms are superior, the one with the
#' highest probability of being the overall best will become the new control),
#' the previous control will be dropped for inferiority, and all remaining arms
#' will be immediately compared to the new control in the same adaptive analysis
#' and dropped if inferior (or possibly equivalent/futile, see below) compared
#' to this new control arm. Only applies in trials with a common `control`.
#' - `control_prob_fixed`: If the length is 1, then this allocation probability
#' will be used for the `control` group (including if a new arm becomes the
#' control and the original control is dropped). If multiple values are specified
#' the first value will be used when all arms are active, the second when one
#' arm has been dropped, and so forth. If 1 or more values are specified,
#' previously set `fixed_probs`, `min_probs` or `max_probs` for new control arms
#' will be ignored. If all allocation probabilities do not sum to 1 (e.g, due to
#' multiple limits) they will be rescaled to do so.\cr
#' Can also be set to one of the special arguments `"sqrt-based"`,
#' `"sqrt-based start"`, `"sqrt-based fixed"` or `"match"` (written exactly as
#' one of those, case sensitive). This requires `start_probs` to be `NULL` and
#' relevant `fixed_probs` to be `NULL` (or `NA` for the control arm).\cr
#' If one of the `"sqrt-based"/"sqrt-based start"/"sqrt-based fixed"` options
#' are used, the function will set *square-root-transformation-based* starting
#' allocation probabilities. These are defined as:\cr
#' `square root of number of non-control arms to 1-ratio for other arms`\cr
#' scaled to sum to 1, which will generally increase power for comparisons
#' against the common `control`, as discussed in, e.g., *Park et al, 2020*
#' \doi{10.1016/j.jclinepi.2020.04.025}.\cr
#' If `"sqrt-based"`, square-root-transformation-based allocation probabilities
#' will also be used for new controls when arms are dropped. If
#' `"sqrt-based start"`, the control arm will be fixed to this allocation
#' probability at all times (also after arm dropping, with rescaling as
#' necessary, as specified above). If `"sqrt-based fixed"` is chosen,
#' square-root-transformation-based allocation probabilities will be used and
#' all allocation probabilities will be fixed throughout the trial (with
#' rescaling when arms are dropped).\cr
#' If `"match"` is specified, the control group allocation probability will
#' always be *matched* to be similar to the highest non-control arm allocation
#' probability.
#'
#' \strong{Superiority and inferiority}
#'
#' In trial designs without a common control arm, superiority and inferiority
#' are assessed by comparing all ***currently active*** groups. This means that
#' if a "final" analysis of a trial without a common control and `> 2 arms` is
#' conducted including all arms (as will often be done in practice) *after* an
#' adaptive trial has stopped, the final probabilities of the best arm being
#' superior may differ slightly.\cr
#' For example, in a trial with three arms and no common `control` arm, one arm
#' may be dropped early for inferiority defined as `< 1%` probability of being
#' the overall best `arm`. The trial may then continue with the two remaining
#' arms, and stopped when one is declared superior to the other defined as
#' `> 99%` probability of being the overall best `arm`. If a final analysis is
#' then conducted including all arms, the final probability of the best arm
#' being overall superior will generally be slightly lower as the probability
#' of the first dropped arm being the best will often be `> 0%`, even if very
#' low and below the inferiority threshold.\cr
#' This is less relevant trial designs *with* a common `control`, as pairwise
#' assessments of superiority/inferiority compared to the common `control` will
#' not be influenced similarly by previously dropped arms (and previously
#' dropped arms may be included in the analyses, even if posterior distributions
#' are not returned for those).
#' Similarly, in actual clinical trials and when `randomised_at_looks` is
#' specified with numbers higher than the number of patients with available
#' outcome data at each analysis, final probabilities may change somewhat when
#' the all patients are have completed follow-up and are included in a final
#' analysis.
#'
#' \strong{Equivalence}
#'
#' Equivalence is assessed ***after*** both inferiority and superiority have
#' been assessed (and in case of superiority, it will be assessed against the
#' new `control` arm in designs with a common `control`, if specified - see
#' above).
#'
#' \strong{Futility}
#'
#' Futility is assessed ***after*** inferiority, superiority, ***and***
#' equivalence have been assessed (and in case of superiority, it will be
#' assessed against the new control arm in designs with a common control, if
#' specified - see above). Arms will thus be dropped for equivalence before
#' futility.
#'
#' \strong{Varying probability thresholds}
#'
#' Different probability thresholds (for superiority, inferiority, equivalence,
#' and futility) may be specified for different adaptive analyses. This may be
#' used, e.g., to apply more strict probability thresholds at earlier analyses
#' (or make one or more stopping rules not apply at earlier analyses), similar
#' to the use of monitoring boundaries with different thresholds used for
#' interim analyses in conventional, frequentist group sequential trial designs.
#' See the **Basic examples** vignette
#' (`vignette("Basic-examples", package = "adaptr")`) for an example.

#' Setup a trial specification using a continuous, normally distributed outcome
#'
#' Specifies the design of an adaptive trial with a continuous, normally
#' distributed outcome and validates all inputs. Uses normally distributed
#' posterior distributions for the mean values in each
#' trial arm; technically, no priors are used (as using *normal-normal*
#' conjugate prior models with extremely wide or uniform priors gives similar
#' results for these simple, unadjusted estimates). This corresponds to the use
#' of improper, flat priors, although not explicitly specified as such. Use
#' [calibrate_trial()] to calibrate the trial specification to obtain a specific
#' value for a certain performance metric (e.g., the Bayesian type 1 error
#' rate). Use [run_trial()] or [run_trials()] to conduct single/multiple
#' simulations of the specified trial, respectively.\cr
#' **Note:** `add_info` as specified in [setup_trial()] is set to the arms and
#' standard deviations used for trials specified using this function.\cr
#' **Further details:** please see [setup_trial()]. See [setup_trial_binom()]
#' for simplified setup of trials with binomially distributed binary outcomes.
#' \cr
#' For additional trial specification examples, see the the
#' **Basic examples** vignette
#' (`vignette("Basic-examples", package = "adaptr")`) and the
#' **Advanced example** vignette
#' (`vignette("Advanced-example", package = "adaptr")`).
